I studied piano performance for 12 years with the incomparable [Beth S. Chen](http://www.americantowns.com/nj/freehold/news/beth-s-chen-retires-as-conductor-of-monster-concert-23482864). 

I performed at all three performance spaces at Carnegie Hall, and participated in the Shanghai International Childrenâ€™s Cultural Art Festival and the Golden Key Music Festival of Vienna. I recieved honors from the National Piano Guild, Cecilian Music Club, and the NJMTA for my solo and ensemble performance.
