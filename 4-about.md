hi! my name is amrita mazumdar. 

right now i live in seattle where i do research with computers, run around, play with clothes, and drink coffee. 

before that, i lived in new york city and went to columbia university, where i did research with computers, cameras, and old books. i spent a summer at brown university and another at ibm vermont.

before that, i spent all my summers at the jersey shore where i grew up. 

i'm still figuring out what goes here. i tweet a bit: [@amritamaz](http://www.twitter.com/amritamaz)
