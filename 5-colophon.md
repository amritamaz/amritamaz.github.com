This site is generated with Jekyll and Sass. 
The font is Karla by Jonathan Pinhorn, served by Google Web Fonts. 
The site is hosted on Github Pages.

I do my web design hacking in Sublime Text 3. I also sometimes write 
my blog posts there. Typically, I write and edit my blog posts in iA Writer for Mac.
Occassionally, I write my posts on my iPad with iA Writer. Even more infrequently, 
inspiration strikes and I draft up posts with Notesy on my iPhone, which I sync 
via Dropbox to nvAlt on my Mac. 

Photos were likely taken with an iPhone 5S or Nikon D90 with a Sigma 17-70 f/2.8 lens.

I only tested this site on my MacBook Pro using Google Chrome, and my iPhone and iPad using Safari. Your mileage may vary.
