This site is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and 
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

The font is [Karla](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/karla) by 
[Jonathan Pinhorn](https://twitter.com/jonpinhorn_type), served by 
[Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). 

The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I do most of my text editing in [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). 
Sometimes, I do write in [iA Writer for Mac](https://ia.net/writer/mac/). For quick edits I'll use [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim).

Occassionally, I write my posts on my iPad with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/ios). 
Even more infrequently, I will use 
[Notesy](http://notesy-app.com/) on my iPhone, synced via 
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) to [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) on my Mac. 

Photos were likely taken with an iPhone 5S or Nikon D90 with a Sigma 17-70 f/2.8 lens.

I only tested this site on my MacBook Pro using Google Chrome, and my iPhone and iPad using Safari. Your mileage may vary.
