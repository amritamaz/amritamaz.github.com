Every year, I try to read 100 books. This year, I read 109 books! As always, I collected some data as I went along
and made some graphs, and wrote up some of my thoughts about this year in my reading. The full list is at the bottom 
of the post.

## how often did i read?

<div id="over_time_plot" class="plot">

I read pretty consistently over the course of the year. I like reading both when I'm stressed and when
I want to relax, so it doesn't surprise me that the second half of the year (vacations and
deadlines) had a lot of pages read.

## how did i read books?

<div id="book_fmt_plot" class="plot" style="margin:auto;width:500px;">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/books2015/book_fmt.svg"
        width="200" height="350"
        alt="book format plot">
</div>

I tried out a few different formats of books: physical books courtesy of the University 
of Washington libraries, and e-books and audiobooks from the Seattle Public Library. 
I wasn't a huge fan of audiobooks - I enjoyed listening on my walks and bus rides, and 
while cooking, but didn't feel like I retained much. Overall, it was okay for easy non-fiction
and fiction, but miserable for dense non-fiction I seek to learn from. 

E-books are probably the fan favorite for the year. I read them on my iPad or iPhone, and use iBooks for books
I already possess and Overdrive for library books. They are painless (and practically weightless!) to travel with, especially
on red-eye flights where dark mode is much nicer than a bright overhead light. I also like reading harder texts as e-books 
because I can look up hard words (#literary). I pretty
much only read physical books in the first half of the year, when I didn't have any good e-books to read, and when I couldn't
acquire an e-copy of a book I wanted to read.

## what kinds of books did i read?

<div id="book_cat_plot" class="plot">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/books2015/book_cat.svg"
        width="500" height="350"
        alt="book category plot">
</div>

This graph isn't very actionable, but I like the "knowledge" of what kinds of books I've been reading. Knowledge is in quotes there because in compiling this data
genres are a useless metric. In fact, I not only do I think genres are useless but maybe even the categories of fiction and nonfiction[^1]. Increasingly,
I'm finding that good books span all different "categories", and may even overlap. For instance, this "diaspora" category I 
listed encapsulates a lot of "post-colonial" or "immigrant American" writing like Jhumpa Lahiri and Zadie Smith, but 
also Kevin Kwan's "Crazy Rich Asians" series, which is pretty much Gossip Girls for mid-20's SE-Asian populations (but super fun!). 
Is Kim Gordon's "Girl in a Band" a book about music, art, feminism, or a memoir? "Contemporary" is a fun category for books that
I couldn't really figure out but weren't "historically"-themed. There are so many books I'd like to read and I
feel like they're all so different, but I'm not sure how to categorize them. Genres don't make any sense. 


## how hard were the books? how much did i like them?

<div id="book_diff_plot" class="plot" style="float:left">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/books2015/book_diff.svg"
        width="200" height="350"
        alt="book difficulty plot">
</div>

<div id="book_enjoy_plot" class="plot" >
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/books2015/book_enjoy.svg"
        width="200" height="350"
        alt="book enjoyment plot">
</div>

Not a lot to say and learn about these, but I took down this information so figured I'd share it - difficulty is how 
much perceived effort I had to put into reading a book, and enjoyment is how I felt about the book when I was done. Some
books are hard to get through but I feel like I learned a lot - a lot of non-fiction falls into this category. Other books
are easy reading but I ended up not liking them. 

A note on these metrics: I simultaneously rated these books myself and on Goodreads, where I like to see
what other people think about the book. Their rating system is so strange to me! 5 = amazing, 4 = really liked it, 3 = liked it, 
2 = ok, and 1 = did not like it. This means that a bunch of books that are fine are getting only 2 stars, which seems 
shockingly low. So, no, I do not subscribe to the Goodreads rating system, and instead use the Amrita rating system illustrated above,
and I am very happy about it.

## who wrote the books i read?

<div id="author_demo_plot" class="plot" >
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/books2015/book_cat.svg"
        width="200" height="350"
        alt="author demographics plot">
</div>

It has recently come into vogue to publicly decry the presence of white men in peoples' libraries, and to 
eschew all books written by white men in favor of women and people of color.[^3] I did this, and it was AWESOME.
It was extremely easy for me (likely because of my tastes and circles of friends) to find lots of great writing
by women, but harder for me to find books by people of color, especially women of color. I focused mostly
on Indian- and Asian-American writing in my branching out, a category I'd like make broader this year. Most of these authors,
however, write fiction, and I found it hard to find nonfiction that wasn't memoirs written by people who weren't white men[^4].
 
A nice goal for the coming year is to keep this heatmap fairly level -- I think the point of experiments 
like "read only women" or "read only people of color" is to broaden one's reading horizons, and maintaining 
a level heatmap is a nice way of visualizing this.

## the unfinished

In my push towards 100+ books, a few books were left unfinished. I am pretty good at forcing myself through a book,
so not completing a book only happened for three reasons: (1) the book was too long (2) I had other books I preferred reading (3)
the book was actually the worst book ever written.[^5] Upon reflection, many of the books that were overly long may have suffered from the
"too long to be read comfortably on an e-reader" -- one was an anthology of short stories, another was a big collection of essays
and letters, and they were both over 1500+ ebook pages. It's hard to work my mind around the idea of working through a book slowly,
with interruptions and other books in between, but with a huge collection of short stories it seems like a better way of actually
finishing the book. This year, I'll strive to pick up some of my unfinished ones in physical form - hopefully this will help!

If I didn't finish a book and it wasn't that long, it was probably nonfiction, typically of the business/productivity/technical ilk.
This is an area I'm struggling with a lot - I want to read these books, mostly so I can criticize them, but a lot of the books 
are terribly written. For every okay one I read, I read 3-7 more that are drivel, and the writing is painful for me to read. A logical 
person [^6] would question why I want to read books I will probably hate, and the illogical answer is that I actually am curious
about what they have to say, even if I know I probably won't like how they say it. So many people
claim to love and recommend these kinds of books! I want to develop informed opinions about them (even if they will mostly be negative), so 
I can effectively respond to these boring-book celebrationists. 

## bookbag - my private goodreads

Last year, I kept a small text document with a list of books I finished and when. The charts in last year's post were made by hand 
in Keynote, which was kinda fun but not sustainable. This year, I expanded on that list with enjoyment and difficulty, pages, 
and author demographics, and created [`bookbag`](https://github.com/amritamaz/bookbag), a simple command line tool to add books and move them between my 'to-read' and 'finished' lists. I think it is easy enough for anyone who likes the command line but is afraid of web servers can operate.
I also made little static-web-views for the two lists for easy reference. One cool thing I let bookbag do was 'recommend' books from my list based on
what kind of book I was looking for - fiction, nonfiction, by a woman, etc. 

A savvy Internet-goer will recognize that I've essentially encapsulated the functionality of Goodreads, but without the flashy website and social features. I use Goodreads, too, but I like being able to accommodate my personal data analysis whims and fancies[^7]. Moving forward, I'd like to move this into a flashy (but simple!) web server that also does my visualizations for me - like my yearly recap, but in real time. A lot of these charts are hacked together,
and more automation would be a real help in writing these posts and making reading choices I'm happier with!

## next up

I'm going to hold steady at a goal of 100 books for this year. I feel like the intensity was good, and was sufficiently challenging for 
me to keep up again for this year. What I would like to change is the way I count books towards the goal - I feel like I read a 
lot of easy books less because I wanted to and more because it would help me towards my goal. Instead, I'd like to shoot for 100 **useful**
books: books that are on my list, books that I learned from, books that I really enjoyed. This year, I read ten Pretty Little Liars 
books and five serialized mystery books - they were fun, I guess, but I didn't really feel like I had grown as a person afterwards. There
are so many fun books that I can also learn from[^8], and I have almost 700 books on my list of books to read - I don't need to pad it with
books that are a waste of my time.

I also want to switch off between fiction and non-fiction - I know [other people that do this](http://www.dougwoos.com/2013/12/31/my-year-of-non-fiction.html) with different frequencies and it seems like a good way to incentivize reading books that are less tempting to read.

[^1]: Some non-fiction memoirs read like fiction, and some fiction reads like a letter from your best friend. Some fictional short stories are so loosely fictionalized that it's basically anonymous nonfiction, and some non-fiction has so many liberties taken with it that it's pretty much made up. Objectivity is a lie!!

[^2]: If I bought all 109 books I read from used bookstores at about $8 a book, I would be out over $850! And I didn't even like some of those!

[^3]: For people who are unfamiliar with this trend, good discussions of this topic can be found [here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/20/i-only-read-non-white-authors-for-12-months-what-i-learned-surprised-me) and [here](http://incisive.nu/2015/no-country/). A great list of recent fiction to start with can be found [here](http://www.buzzfeed.com/isaacfitzgerald/books-we-loved-in-2015). If you have suggestions for non-fiction by women or people of color for me to read, please let me know!

[^4]: A caveat to this data collection is that I pretty much self-assessed authors' demographics - if you've won an award from some cultural or gender-specific literary group, it was easy to identify, but I'm sure I mischaracterized a few authors. I'm not sure what the right way to do this assessment is.

[^5]: Full disclosure: there was only one occurence of this and I don't feel the need to publicly shame the book, but it was actually awful and offensive and painfully written and I was heartened to see everyone else on Goodreads hated it, too.  

[^6]: Like my friends who read and don't understand why I read books I don't want to read, shout out to friends who read!

[^7]: Like the author demographics, and analytics based on page count. Also, my data is kept in a csv file I can edit in a plaintext editor on my phone and I like it that way.

[^8]: Some suggestions are "Where'd You Go, Bernadette?" by Maria Semple, "Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore" by Robin Sloan, and "The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again)".
