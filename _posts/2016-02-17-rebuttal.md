I don't have any good insight on writing rebuttals, being just a paper writer and
not yet a paper reviewer. Writing rebuttals, an act fairly new and computer-science-conference
exclusive, isn't a topic with a lot of resources on the internet.

So, I decided to spend some time on the internet collecting advice from others.

+ [Matt Might's "Responding to peer review"](http://matt.might.net/articles/peer-review-rebuttals/): A nice format for rebuttals, and example text.
+ [Albrect Schmidt's "Suggestions to writing rebuttals"](http://albrecht-schmidt.blogspot.pt/2012/11/sigchi-rebuttals-some-suggestions-to.html): From the perspective of CHI, but
also some good guidance on getting started writing.
+ [Mike Ernst's "Responding to conference reviews"](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/write-technical-paper.html#responding-to-reviews): A concise but comprehensive look at how
one might approach writing rebuttals. I like his advice a lot.
