title: Other people's advice on writing rebuttals 
categories: [blog]
---

I don't have any good insight on writing rebuttals, being just a paper writer and
not yet a paper reviewer. Writing rebuttals, an act fairly new and computer-science-conference
exclusive, isn't a topic with a lot of resources on the internet. 

So, I decided to compile a compendium of advice from others - this will probably 
start off as a linked list until
I have a critical mass of advice and some sufficient personal experience to guide me.

+ [Matt Might's "Responding to peer review"](mattmight): A nice format for rebuttals, and example text.
+ [Albrect Schmidt's "Suggestions to writing rebuttals"](albrecht): From the perspective of CHI, but
also some good guidance on getting started writing.
+ [Mike Ernst's "Responding to conference reviews"](mernst): A concise but comprehensive look at how
one might approach writing rebuttals. I like his advice a lot.
