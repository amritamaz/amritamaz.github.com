Every year, I try to read 100 books. This year I read 145! Here's some analysis of the
books I read, reflections on my reading and habits, and some goals for next year's reading.

## the basics

Reading began on January 1 and proceeded thusly.

I feel kind of ambivalent about completing my goal
this year -- I crossed the 100 book threshold in September, and while
that didn't slow down my progress, I kind of felt like my reading
has really become a strong habit, and I've fully adjusted to my life
as a frequent reader.


Here's how I progressed over time. It looks like a pretty even slope
to me, which sounds right when compared with my impression of fairly consistent and regular reading habits. I'm always worried that after seeking to complete some concrete books goal, I'm going to grow tired of it and
stop reading, forever, or even a month. But I found that a healthy variety of
genres, styles, and reading media helped keep me active in my reading efforts.

By the end of the year, I had subbed out my least favorite podcasts for audiobooks, and also tried to read more
physical books.

    alt="book format plot">
</div>

I have a really tall stack of physical books
I keep buying and not reading, which is new for me! My rule used to be to only buy books I had read and loved. I started breaking this rule when authors would come to Seattle for readings, and I wanted to support them/have them sign a copy of their book for me. I continued to break this rule during a bunch of holiday book sales. I guess in 2017 I will seek to read more of the physical books I keep buying and not opening.

</div>

Amazing news: I didn't hate a single book I read this year! I can't decide if this is because I got
better at choosing books I'd enjoy, or more compassionate towards books that may have been
not-great. I actually feel that I've become more critical judging a book's merits and
drawbacks, so I've probably gotten better at skewing my
choices towards Books that are Good that I Will Like. That doesn't mean I'm not judgy! I read
ten whole books this year that were Awful. But I think there are many
collections of writing that are good but not all the way amazing,
and as I read more I have started becoming more discerning about what
makes a book good to me vs. objectively high quality. I guess finding
my own taste is a positive development in my reading career, so I should be happy about new growth and changes beyond just completing my reading goal.

## new friends

Before diving deeper into [who and what and where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3mizjVS5Q4), it's worth
discussing what's new in my reading lifestyle, the stuff around the reading.

1. I bought a Kindle this year! I previously read on my iPad, but my eyes have been struggling more with
screen-staring[^1] and travelling with five books for a weekend trip is no fun. Hot take: I'm enjoying
it! It has the benefits of e-reading such as syncing with my phone so I can read while on lines,
while overall reducing my eye strain. I can read my library books on it, free books from Project Gutenberg,
and ebooks I've bought from indie booksellers like Verso Books or Emily Books, who often bundle ebooks
with physical copy purchases.

2. I really leaned into using Goodreads this year. I have friends on there who I like to keep up with,
it's easy to find and update my reading habits (especially because of the Kindle integration), and
I like to support authors by rating their work! A fun new thing I did in zest was attend book events
and author readings, which has introduced me to many smart and thoughtful new writers. Many of these
books, especially independently printed ones, don't have many ratings on Goodreads, so I feel like
shows of support there are useful.

    So what about my little personal tools I cobbled together? I'm still using them! Goodreads isn't
    the perfect system for me (they don't let me track things I care about like author demographics,
    or fine-grained topic tags like I've been using), and it certainly isn't a substitute for these fun year-in-review
    posts. In 2015, I collected some metadata on what I was reading, which I hoped would
    help me achieve some sort of great balance in my reading material. I continued to collect this data
    in 2016, but didn't end up "checking my progress" with this data like I intended. I did find
    that the act of recording it did keep me generally mindful on the quality and topics I read on, which
    is probably the most I can hope to expect from logging like this.

3. Another new-in-2016 book development is that I signed up for the [Book of the Month Club](https://www.bookofthemonth.com)[^2].
The hip and happening new books tend to have excrutiatingly long wait times at the library,
and I figured this would be a fun way to conveniently get copies of the new books I want to read. I
still purchase the bulk of my books at local bookstores and yard sales (I'm still a grad student, after all) but
the prices are very reasonable for new hardcovers and they always send a very sturdy bookmark. Otherwise,
I'm mostly getting my books from the library like in past years.

[^1]: I think it's because I've been working harder this year :wink:

[^2]: [Here's my referral link](https://www.mybotm.com/3jzvapjudd0lik9). If you use it when you sign up, you'll get 3 months for $10 each (that's $30 for three hardcover books!) , and I'll get a free book.

## what i read

A consequence of doing these roundups every year is that people ask my opinion of all these books
I read. They want to know what I liked and didn't like and what would I recommend for their next long
flight? This year I explored some new-to-me genres: academic nonfiction/essays, poetry, and science fiction, which led me to discover some new favorites in genres I wouldn't expect.[^3] Thanks
to Seattle Public Library's Summer Book Bingo challenge[^4], I broke into reading YA as a grown up[^5], which
is so enjoyable that I am certainly going to continue.
I also have felt compelled to gift books to friends this year, which made me
thoughtful about what books impacted me that I would feel comfortable paying money to give to someone
else.

### Top 8 (unordered, probably)

I was surprised to find that even though I read almost 150 books, the standouts were clear, few, and
immediately obvious to me. Lots of books were good, really good! But when I tried to pick 10 but it was
hard to pick books that I loved as deeply as the eight
that stood out immediately. I honestly didn't know I would love all these books right away,
and some I didn't realize I loved until later when I couldn't stop thinking or talking about them. All
of these books are A++++. *Brown Girl
Dreaming* is notable for being the only book I read on audiobook that made such a deep impact. *Dietland*
is probably the least perfect or popular book on the list, but is such delicious wish fulfillment that
I think of it very often.

    The Argonauts, Maggie Nelson
    The Fire Next Time, James Baldwin
    Brown Girl Dreaming, Jaqueline Woodson
    The Vegetarian, Han Kang
    The Buddha in the Attic, Julie Otsuka
    Stories of Your Life and Others, Ted Chiang
    How to Be Both, Ali Smith
    Dietland, Sarai Walker

### Genre Fiction

I really pushed my love of genre fiction this year, like mystery/thrillers and easy-read-white-women-fiction.
I read some really brilliant genre fiction this year,
and learned a lot from discussion on what gets classified as genre and what doesn't (TODO rewrite).
I also found that there is lovely writing to be found in every genre, which can outweigh my preferences
against any specific category.
Sometimes I feel compelled to stop wasting my time[^6] on "lowbrow" or "un-serious" books, but I find
that a lot of genre labels tend to be unnecessarily pejorative.
After speaking more openly about my exxcitement about certain great pieces of genre fiction, people
came to me in hushed tones telling me they were embarrassed to talk about liking genre fiction because it wasn't Serious Reading.
I want to kind of push at this tension more - reading should be fun and enjoyable, and the kinds of books that
get published as pulp or fantasy or whatever else point to real and true social concerns that the people
want to read about!

More importantly for me, there's some really exciting books to be found out there, even outside the Pulitzer and
Man Booker Award winners.
Jenny Han's young adult novels made me wish I was a young adult again (crazy, I know!). Megan Abbott's
pulpy thrillers are kind of formulaic, but the formula is so so brilliant that I'm enthralled every time.
Uptown Thief, [which Jean Yang reviewed for Jacobin](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/09/romance-novel-uptown-thief-aya-de-leon/),
is a thoughtful social justice narrative wrapped up in a fun and flirty romance novel. Liz Hand's
mysteries are dark and seedy and haunting with a punk feminist bent, great for winter reading.

    To All The Boys I've Loved Before, Jenny Han
    Queenpin, Megan Abbott
    Uptown Thief, Aya de Leon
    Generation Loss, Elizabeth Hand

### Memoir Audiobooks Narrated by the Author

My feelings on audiobooks have also changed. I used to find them horribly unpleasant, especially
for serious nonfiction or fiction with multiple characters.
Memoir or essays narrated by the author have proven to be the exception! Especially with
actors or comedians, you can get a lot out of listening to their book that
one may not elicit from reading. Hearing Maya Angelou or Jaqueline Woodson sing songs from
their childhood, or Taraji P. Henson imitate her casting agent, is something I could not possibly guess, and
really adds a lot to a story!

    I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou
    Brown Girl Dreaming, Jaqueline Woodson
    Year of Yes, Shonda Rhimes
    Shrill, Lindy West
    Round the Way Girl, Taraji P Henson
    In The Country We Love: My Family Divided, Diane Guerrero

[^3]: Turns out, there is some really great poetry in this world that will make you cry a lot if you have feelings. Almost all the poetry collections I read this year were brilliant and inspiring.

[^4]: You can see my Book Bingo card [here](https://twitter.com/amritamaz/status/773284345960210432).

[^5]: I read YA when I was a kid! But not really since, which is a shame because there is so much good writing to be found there. If you're thinking about it, Jenny Han's books, specifically, transported me back to middle school in all its tumultuous glory in such an evocative way that I almost wanted to go back. Almost.

[^6]: See [last year's book reflections](http://amritamaz.net/books/books-2015) for more on this -- I don't really agree with it anymore, but it's interesting context for how a single person's perspective on reading can change over a year of consistent reading.

## the list

If you're looking at what I read this year for a potential recommendation, [the library]({{site.baseurl}}/library/) is where I'm collecting my favorite books of all time. I'm not sure what I'll do with it, but I like having it up on here as a testament to my favorite hobby.

For completeness, here's the year's book list and some of the metadata I collected. I only included the boolean categories
for ease of perusing, but I also kept track of how many pages
were in the book, how hard I found the book (I didn't find many books to be seriously challenging, but again this was a good checkpoint for me). I think one reason I continue filling out
this data in addition to logging completion on a place like Goodreads is that it's a good reflection period for me after I read.

In 2017 I'd like to broaden this with a sentence or two of what I liked and didn't like. My ambivalence about how "good" a book is past a certain quality metric means that the fine-grained notes of writing style, plot, etc., i.e. what made the book worth reading or not, get lost in the shuffle. I keep most of these things in my brain, but it might better help develop my taste and recommendations for others if I organized the merits of the books more concretely. We'll see how this fleshes out in the year to come.
