Every year I like to review my reading activity over the year and square it against any set goals. This year, I read precisely 150 books, which was exactly my goal! Here's a little retrospective on my year in reading.

## simple math

Some graphs, for the people who come here for my book graphs. Here's how many books I read by month.

<div id="by-month" style="text-align:center"></div>

And then cumulative pages over time.

<div id="pagesTime" style="text-align:center"></div>

There are some pretty clear plateaus around some deadlines and busy travel I had, which I marked off. Obviously, I can't spend all my time reading,[^1] but I feel like I maintained a pretty even slope of pages accumulation aside from those breaks.

[^1]: This is actually non-obvious to me.

You can also maybe tell when I started my 45-minutes-each-way internship commute, which I got through with strong support from audiobooks. I like my audiobooks to be either: narrated by the author or nonfiction written in a casual, straightforward style (i.e. business books), and this year I exhausted many of my library's online audiobook offerings.

## subject matter

Because I read ebooks, physical books, and audiobooks, I was pretty curious about how that split plays out across book type:

<div id="typeBinding" style="text-align:center"></div>

Most of my audiobooks were nonfiction, but a few were fiction (and they were very enjoyable!). I think podcasts have trained me to enjoy a well-read nonfiction audiobook, which conveniently allows me to read a lot of books I meant to read but couldn't make reading priority for.

I didn't listen to any poetry audiobooks, which is a bummer because I really love poetry readings, especially when poems are read by the author. I discovered one of my favorite poets, Jenny Zhang, on a podcast where she read a poem, and would really like to enjoy more poetry that way; so please let me know if you have any favorite poetry audiobooks, especially read by the author!!

Looking at a split across genres, I'm pretty happy with the distribution (mostly expected, but a pretty long tail of genres here!):

<div id="genre" style="text-align:center"></div>

Some new-to-me genres:

+ romance, which started as a free-KFC-themed-romance-novel joke but is looking to become a growing part of my reading distribution in 2018
+ children's, which started as a "picked up an interesting book in the bookstore and turns out children's books are really easy to read fast" but has become my new strategy for vetting presents for my little cousins and nieces and nephews
+ philosophy, which it turns out feels very accessible when presented via audiobook

<div id="typePages" style="text-align:center"></div>

This graph was not something I would have planned to include of my own volition, but it was suggested to me by Voyager, the [Vega]-based tool I used to generate all these graphs and I thought it was kind of interesting. According to the visualization, I read many long fiction books, but I also read some long non-fiction too, which is hard for me so good job to me! The three longest nonfiction books I read were Hillary Clinton's HARD CHOICES and WHAT HAPPENED, and Steven Levy's HACKERS[^2]. The three longest fiction books I read were THE GOLDFINCH by Donna Tartt, THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES by Tom Wolfe, and NIGHT FILM by Marisha Pessl.

[^2]: Which was so dry it took like 3 years to work up the emotional energy to churn through.

## good and bad

Here's the distribution of how much I enjoyed these books.

<div id="rating" style="text-align:center"></div>

I read a bunch of good books and some bad ones. Even though there are more poor books on this list than past years, it's worth noting that only 5% of books were lower than 3 stars, and 17% were 5 stars which I consider the "amazing perfect put this book in everyone's hands".

Something notable compared to prior years doing this book retrospective is that I really shirked use of the book logging tools I'd created in past years. As a result, there's a bit less data to "consider" than usual. A few challenges came up: I'm not always by my computer, sometimes I really want to add a book from my phone, during my internship I had tons of idle time but didn't feel like downloading all of my little scripts and services to putz with book lists on my work machine.

There is also some types of resistance in maintaining these lists that I am still working out how to reconcile: a preponderance of services for managing different library book lists, comparing those lists with books I already have, coming up with a simple and portable way to add books that I hear about in different situations (at a book reading, in the middle of another book, etc). It seems that Goodreads is the grudging solution[^3] but I am toying with ways to make my life managing the never ending deluge of written word easier in some ways.

[^3]: Err, add me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10705886-amrita)?

## how i did it

When I tell people who are not as aggressive of readers "oh, I just reached my goal of reading 150 books!" they often respond incredulously, so here are some thoughts on "how did I do that":

*There aren't really any secrets on "how to read more" except, well, read more. For instance, if you get carsick on a long bus commute you can listen to audiobooks. If you are waiting in a long coffeeshop line you can open Kindle on your phone instead of Twitter or e-mail. These are hacks, but I get most of my reading done in 2-3 hour windows on the couch with blankets and many cups of coffee or tea.*

*Short story collections take longer for me to read than novels because the natural break makes me want to stop reading far earlier than I probably could have sustained.*

*Poetry is the worst in "time to read a page" because I like to really sit with a poem, not just gloss over it and think about them all in a whole batch at the end[^4].*

*Towards the end of my year, when I realized work and travel had left me straggling on my goal, I read a lot of slim novels that had few dots on the Kindle counter -- I don't think this is __cheating__ per se, and I don't regret reading the shorter books I selected, but I wish it hadn't felt so cheap to prioritize them on December 30th and 31st.*

[^4]: I actually prefer doing both? Like I'll sit with a poem a day, then I'll do a big batch skimming of the whole series to figure out my general impression. But I have very little background in reading poetry so this could be wrong too???

## some of my favorites

Intrepid blog readers already know that I've been making notes on the books I read in quarterly-ish posts ([one], [two], [three]), so if you're curious on my thoughts on any specific book you can find them there.

That being said, a fun party trick is to say "Hey, have you read this book? It's so good, I really loved it and I think you will too, I really can't recommend it highly enough" and then ghost, because it's basically like a goodbye with homework and they can't even be upset with you later because then they will have revealed themselves as contacting you before doing their required reading. So here are some new-ish books that I found myself recommending a lot after reading this year:

    Caucasia, Danzy Senna
    Chemistry, Weike Wang
    Difficult Women, Roxane Gay
    Electric Arches, Eve Ewing
    Exit West, Mohsin Hamid
    Faces in the Crowd, Valeria Luisella
    Ghachar Ghochar, Vivek Shanbhag
    Human Acts, Han Kang
    Miss Burma, Charmaine Craig
    No One Can Pronounce My Name, Rakesh Satyal
    One Day We’ll All Be Dead, Scaachi Koul
    Sour Heart, Jenny Zhang
    Tender Points, Amy Berkowitz
    The Idiot, Elif Batuman
    The Sympathizer, Viet Thanh Nguyen
    Too Much and Not the Mood, Durga Chew-Bose

## what's next

My Goodreads friends will know that I have set another 150 book goal this year, but I'm ambivalent about achieving it for two reasons: pacing and goals.

*Pacing*: I did a poor job pacing last year, which resulted in me coasting along with about 15 books in the last 4 days of 2017. I read them, but pretty quickly, even when I wanted to spend more time savoring them[^5]. I'm on track to do about as poorly this year[^6], so I would like to use my quarterly book review posts as a time to catch up to my goal pace as well.

[^5]: Now I have a new note on my phone called "BOOKS TO SAVOR LATER".
[^6]: Goodreads tells me I'm already 3 books behind.

*Goals*: One thing I did to quickly rack up books towards the end of my goal was google "Best Short Books You Can Read in A Day" which I ended up reading in 2-3 hours each. Some of these books were great, some I had been meaning to read and others were happy surprises, so that's not to say I'm not happy about this. But a new book showed up in my local book store that's 1,660 pages long and I really want to read it! And I recently met an Important Literary Person who asked me if I had read This Classic Book and That Classic Book and I hadn't read them, not for any lack of wanting to but just I hadn't gotten around to it. Implictly, I feel like the only reason to really read 150 books per year is to read the really good ones - but if I actively miss them because I'm reading whatever's available from the library when I'm waiting to board a plane[^7], I don't think I'm using my effort towards this goal wisely.

[^7]: This is a little unfair because I would say the majority of the books I read are good books, that I want to read for some reason or another, but I also have a note on my phone of books to read that's like over 1000 books deep, so I shouldn't really be waffling around here.

Now that I know that 150 books per year is within reach[^8], I would like to be more deliberate with my reading goals and tackle some things that I have mentioned in past retrospectives but never truly formalized.

[^8]: Some may ask "are you really going to read 150 books every year?!" to which I respond: if I read 150 books a year for the next 20 years, I will read 3,000 books, which is twice the length of my current-to-read list and accommodates all the amazing new writing that will come out in the next 20 years that I haven't yet put on my list :P

**Reading Goals in 2018:**

    Read 20 physical books (at least)
    Read 10 nonfiction books (at least)
    Read 10 poetry collections (at least)

The things that are easy for me: new fiction, books by authors I already love, audiobook celebrity memoirs, will likely fill themselves in around the gaps. But it's been almost a year since I last went to the Friends of the Seattle Public Library where every book is a dollar and I've read embarrassingly few of the books I acquired. So I'm going to use what I have and push my reading comfort instead of greedily placing many books on hold at the library!

## the list

Here's the full list, if that's what you're looking for. My friend Mikey put together [a gorgeous 2017 reading retrospective](www.bitsofthat.com/reading2017), which, after seeing, left me no choice but to shamelessly adapt his organizational structure.
