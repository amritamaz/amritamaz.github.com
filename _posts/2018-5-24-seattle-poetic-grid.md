Last year, I was lucky enough to help in the development of the [Seattle Poetic Grid](http://seattlepoeticgrid.com/).
In collaboration with then-Seattle Civic Poet [Claudia Castro Luna](http://www.castroluna.com/) (now Washington Poet Laureate) and cartographer [Gregory Woolston](http://gwoolston.me/), we solicited work from across the city to highlight how place and poetry influence our conception of Seattle.

As Claudia so much more elegantly put it:

    We each carry a personal map of the place we inhabit.
    We live in the city and the city lives in us.
