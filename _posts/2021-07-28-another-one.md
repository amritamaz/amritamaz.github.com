It appears that a great deal of time has passed since my last blog post (three whole years!). Since then, I have:

    + Done a lot more research
    + Published some papers
    + Passed my generals exam (thesis proposal stage)
    + Co-authored some more papers
    + Decided to do a startup from my research
    + Defended my Ph. D. (cool!!)
    + Started up my start-up
    + Lost momentum on the unpublished research projects
    + Somehow kept up startup work through a global pandemic

Since I mostly work by myself on non-research these days and have been reflecting on my graduate research experience for about a year now, now feels like a great time to resurrect the blog. I have some ideas for posts, but if you have questions you'd like to see me talk about, [let me know](mailto:amrita@cs.uw.edu)! I do it all for my fans.
