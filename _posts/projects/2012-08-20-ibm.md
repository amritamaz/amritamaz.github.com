Designed a third-generation array of ring oscillators for hardware disposition
in all future products. Design process included original circuit design and 
implementation, layout, physical and logical checking, simulation, and 
validation of the circuit. 

In collaboration with the ASIC Model-Hardware Correlation team, IBM Burlington.
