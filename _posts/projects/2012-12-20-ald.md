---

A digital hardware subsystem to calculate floating point trigonometric values.
Project involved design and optimization of an entire subsystem using an RTL design ﬂow. 
The final product was a custom trigonometric function hardware accelerator,
which computes both sine and cosine functions, with user-speciﬁed precision
and IEEE 754 single-precision ﬂoating-point number compliance.


In collaboration with Kavita Jain-Cocks for the CSEE 4823 Advanced Logic Design course.
