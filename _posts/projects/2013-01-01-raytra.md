A basic Monte Carlo global illumination 3D rendering system using ray tracing. 
A continuation of the raytracer developed in the COMS 4160 - Computer Graphics 
course with Michael K. Reed. 

Features include spheres, triangles, and planes, with full .obj triangle mesh
processing, support for point, ambient, and area lights with soft shadows, 
jittered Monte-Carlo antialiasing, axis-aligned bounding boxes for acceleration,
direct sampling of area light sources, and support for HDR file-format (.exr).
