GoblinCity is a augmented reality tool for Windows Phone 7,
designed to help users 
build 3D city models in 3D space. It is designed to allow users to easily and 
intuitively construct cities from pre-made models using interactions 
in physical space rather than a virtual 2D screen. This approach 
reduces the complexity of the user interface needed to support 
building selection, translation, rotation, and scaling to just a 
couple of buttons for function selection and a simple handheld AR 
tracker.
