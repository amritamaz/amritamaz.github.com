Kanto is an audio player with frequency visualization, implemented 
on an Altera DE2 Cyclone FPGA. The music player reads a playlist of 
raw waveform files from an SD or SDHC card, plays songs with CD 
quality through the DE2's audio output, performs a real-time FFT, 
and displays the results on the monitor. The implementation uses 
hardware to handle audio output and frequency visualization, and 
software to handle user interaction and system initialization. The 
user can interact with the system using switches for color
mixing and keyboard for fast forward, rewind, and track selection.
