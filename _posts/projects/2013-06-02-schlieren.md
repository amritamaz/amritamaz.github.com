Investigated techniques in state-of-the-art schlieren imaging systems, and
constructed a schlieren optics system at the Columbia Automated Vision Environment.
Project culminated in presentation of current techniques and future interests
in the area, as well as an investigation of noise-related issues in the 
constructed system. 


In collaboration with the Columbia Automated Vision Environment with guidance from
Dr. Shree Nayar and Changyin Zhou.
