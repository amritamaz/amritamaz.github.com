Design and implementation of a _low-power, area-efficient error correction technique_
for sub-threshold nanoscale circuit design. The tool selectively applies reinforcement 
using invariant relationships to correct noise-induced signal errors. Simulations demonstrate our 
synthesized circuits provide _better noise immunity_ than standard CMOS technology 
in tests with limited area and power overhead. Implementation and analysis in Python, 
SPICE, and Mentor Graphics tools.

Work funded by a grant from the <a href="https://parasol.tamu.edu/dreu/">DREU</a> program and supervised by Dr. Iris Bahar
and Marco Donato of Brown University's Laboratory for Engineering Man-Made Systems (LEMS).
Presented at the Brown University Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium.
