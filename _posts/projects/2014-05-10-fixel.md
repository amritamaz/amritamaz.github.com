Fixel is a programming language to build robust image filters with user-friendly syntax. The goal is to leverage social media conventions to reduce the complexities in image filter desgin and easily produce an aesthetic photo. Fixel includes an interpreter to compile into executable Python and a library of built-in functions to facilitate development. 



In collaboration with Kavita Jain-Cocks, Darien Nurse, and Matthew Patey for the COMS 4115 Programming Languages and Translators course.
