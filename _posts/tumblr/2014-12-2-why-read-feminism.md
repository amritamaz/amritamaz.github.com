# reading more feminism made me more productive

When I started grad school, I realized everyone around me was reading books. As a voracious-reader-child, I was familiar with the concept of books, but this notion of using my few grad-school-free hours to read books was a bit foreign. I evaluated the pros and cons of using my free time for leisure reading as follows:

pros: 
- get to tell people I read books
- show my advisors and friends I am #thoughtful
- add more books to my goodreads profile
- have something to do when my phone dies

cons:
- less time for binge-watching TV
- less time for longform think-pieces on the startup/journalism controversy *du jour*
- increased risk of paper cuts
- slightly heavier backpack

A brief cost-benefit analysis later, I requested 48 books from inter-library loan.[^2] I tried not to overthink the order in which I read them, as I only requested books that would improve my mental acuity in some fashion, so any book was better than none at all. Weirdly, I found myself gravitating towards a genre I had never explored before, feminism. 

[^2]: I would **not** recommend doing this. The books arrived in 12-18 book sets every day, and the library threatened to send them away if I did not pick them up in a timely manner. So I filled four tote bags and had a friend drive me home.

Observing that I enjoyed feminist memoirs so much surprised me. I requested books about feminism mostly out of some intellectual obligation to know what everyone else was talking about, in the same way I want to read more about computer history and second-generation immigrants and typography. I didn’t expect that feminist literature, which I perceived as a deep sect of boring academic nonfiction, was actually interesting.[^3] I definitely didn’t expect that the more I read about feminism, the more comfortable I felt as myself. 

[^3]: I hear similar thoughts echoed from a lot of my female friends in STEM/tech. Many of my friends have lamented ‘I wish I had taken more gender studies classes in undergrad’ or ‘I should have switched majors from cs to gender studies.’ I think this part of having your existence be an active part of academic discourse but totally misunderstood in the public eye. Realizing there are people who understand you and write insightful examinations of your struggles, while you feel totally alone and misunderstood, is super weird.

I’m also surprised at the impact these books have had on me, in comparison to the hardboiled mysteries and literary navel gazing I usually read. Each book I read induces a slight epiphany, and I found my self-assessment, focus, and mood have all improved. I find myself less likely to question everything I do and every interaction I have, because I am more secure in my individual identity and existence as the only girl in the room. I have clearer focus in and outside of the workplace because I spend less time fixated on every little microaggresion. All this has led to me being happier and more productive at work.

I don’t have any data to back me up on the claim that resolving some deep-seated identity issues has made me more productive. What I can say is that I’m still working on sorting out gender and identity issues, like a lot of people, and I spent a lot of mental energy -hiding- the fact that being ‘the only *x*’ can be really confusing!  ___, at an MIT panel on technical privilege, called this exhaustion a “psychic toll of that ever-present burden of representing one's race or gender,” words that stuck with me and ultimately inspired me to read more about feminism.

So, if you’re a woman (or not), if you’re in cs, in tech, in any industry, (or not!), if you find your productivity at work or peace-of-mind in life suffering because of gender related issues, here are some books[^4] that helped me deal:

[^4]: yes, i know there are tons more amazing lists of feminist literature exist by many more qualified scholars and obviously this list is influenced by what books were available at the library in the past two months, but it worked for me. YMMV.

1. Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay
	- who should read it: everyone, but also women of color, women in academia, women who binge-consume pop culture, anyone who wants a laundry list of great books to read about interesting women

2. Unlocking the Clubhouse by Jane Margolis and Allan Fischer
	- who should read it: everyone, but also women in STEM/CS, women who call themselves ‘left-brained’, women who say they are bad at math, startup founders, venture capitalists, present and future parents, anyone who writes about or works in STEM/CS

3. Talking Back by bell hooks
	- who should read it: EVERYONE, but also women who are struggling with their identity and voice, women of color, women in academia, women in industry or professional contexts,

If you have recommendations of books that gave you clarity about gender issues, I’d love to hear them!
