<h2>About Amrita</h2>
</section>

I am a computer architect-in-training and writer. I am a PhD student at the University of Washington, avid coffee drinker, and I keep a very detailed diary.

Before graduate school, I lived in New York and studied at Columbia University, mostly about computers, cameras, and old books. I also worked at a chip fab and the second-oldest daily college newspaper.

Before that, I spent all my time at the beach or the mall in New Jersey, where I grew up.
