<article id="about">
        <p>
          I'm in my final year at Columbia University, studying computer engineering and English.
          I am interested in new hardware-software systems, specifically parallel computing architectures
          for graphics and imaging systems.
          In the past, I've worked in computer hardware design, computer vision, and graphics in industry
          and research.
