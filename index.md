I am computer systems and architecture researcher with an emphasis on visual computing applications, like AR/VR and video streaming. Since receiving my PhD in June 2020, I have been building [Vignette AI] [vignetteco], a UW spin-out company based on my visual computing research and funded by a [CoMotion Fellowship] [comotion]. 

My PhD work was advised by Luis Ceze and Mark Oskin in the [Allen School of Computer Science] [cse] at the [University of Washington] [uw]. During grad school, I worked in the [computer architecture group][arch], the [UW Reality Lab][reality], and the [UW DB group][db], as well as with vision and graphics teams at the Facebook Reality Lab and Google Research.

My research focuses on **new systems for VR, video, and graphics** using hardware-software codesign and ML-for-systems techniques. 
My work spans the **glass-to-glass visual computing pipeline**; I like to work on systems problems ranging from camera capture, to visual data processing and storage, to media distribution and rendering.
In my dissertation, I proposed perceptual optimizations, a new class of domain-specific optimizations for vision and graphics workloads, to improve performance for custom hardware accelerators, storage systems, and data management systems.

Before graduate school, I studied [computer engineering] [cs@cu] and [English literature] [eng@cu] at [Columbia University] [cu].
