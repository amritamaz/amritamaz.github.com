**tl;dr** mentors are great! want to work and learn together through mentorship? send me an email!

*(part of a [distributed mentoring movement](http://www.mentoring.is).)*

I've had many great experiences in my life, and each has been supported by countless supportive mentors. I feel lucky that people I looked up to were open to ongoing mentoring relationships; it's important to me to make myself available as a mentor as well!

If you’d like to work together, send an email to **i (at) amritamaz [dot] me**. I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within a week no matter what. If we seem to be a good fit, I'll propose further correspondence and potentially an ongoing mentoring relationship. Please include:

	+ some info about you, your story, your interests
	+ how you found me
	+ what you'd like to gain from a mentoring relationship
	+ any links to profiles/projects you're proud of
