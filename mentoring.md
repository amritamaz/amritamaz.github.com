*(part of a [distributed mentoring movement](http://www.mentoring.is).)*

I've had many great experiences in my life, and each has been supported by countless supportive mentors. I feel lucky that people I looked up to were open to ongoing mentoring relationships; it's important to me to make myself available as a mentor as well!

Some things I've done:

+ I'm in a CS PhD program at the University of Washington.

+ I received a Google Anita Borg Scholarship in 2014, and a CRA-W DREU award in 2013. 

+ I graduated from Columbia University in 2014. I majored in Computer Engineering and minored in English.

+ I was on the board of CU Women in Computer Science

+ I've taught with the CS Emerging Scholars Program, TA'd for the CS department, and tutored middle, high school and college students in math and CS.

+ I did VLSI design at an IBM fab in 2012.

+ I researched computational photography and Schlieren optics from 2009-2011.

+ I was a web developer, blogger, and daily editor at the Columbia Spectator.

+ I once blogged my outfits for 3.5 years (2009-2013). 

If you’d like to work together, send an email to **mentoring (at) amritamaz [dot] me**. I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within a week no matter what. If we seem to be a good fit, I'll propose further correspondence and potentially an ongoing mentoring relationship. Please include:

	+ some info about you, your story, your interests
	+ how you found me
	+ what you'd like to gain from a mentoring relationship
	+ any links to profiles/projects you're proud of
